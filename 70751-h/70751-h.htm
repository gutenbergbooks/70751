  <h2 class="mt5"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2>

  <p>During the year 1916 the author spent five months in archeological
    investigations in New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, three of these
    months being given to intensive work on the Mesa Verde National Park
    in Colorado. An account of the result of the Mesa Verde work will
    appear in the Smithsonian Annual Report for 1916, under the title “A
    Prehistoric Mesa Verde Pueblo and Its People.” What was accomplished in
    June and October, 1916, before and after the work at the Mesa Verde, is
    here recorded.</p>

  <p>As archeological work in the Southwest progresses, it becomes more
    and more evident that we can not solve the many problems it presents
    until we know more about the general distribution of ruins, and the
    characteristic forms peculiar to different geographical localities.
    Most of the results thus far accomplished are admirable, though
    limited to a few regions, while many extensive areas have as yet
    not been explored by the archeologist and the types of architecture
    peculiar to these unexplored areas remain unknown. Here we need a
    reconnoissance followed by intensive work to supplement what has
    already been done. The following pages contain an account of what might
    be called archeological scouting in New Mexico and Utah. While the
    matter here presented may not shed much light on general archeology, it
    is, nevertheless, a contribution to our knowledge of the prehistoric
    human inhabitants of our country. Primarily it treats of aboriginal
    architecture.</p>

  <p>The author spent two months in searching for undescribed buildings
    concerning some of which comparatively nothing was known. During June,
    1916, headquarters were made at Gallup, New Mexico: the Utah ruins, new
    to science, were visited from the Indian agency at Ouray, Utah.</p>

  <p>The plan of operations in these two fields was somewhat different.
    The work in New Mexico was an attempt to verify existing legends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> of
    the migrations of a Hopi (Walpi) clan that once lived in a ruined
    pueblo called Sikyatki, where the cemeteries, exhumed in 1895, yielded
    one of the most beautiful and instructive collections of prehistoric
    pottery<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ever brought to the U. S. National Museum from the Southwest.</p>

  <p>Legends mention by name several habitations of the Sikyatki people
    during their migration from the Jemez region, before they built their
    Hopi pueblo, but lack of time prevented the author from tracing their
    trail throughout the entire distance back to their original home. The
    object of the present investigation was to examine one of their halting
    places, a ruined pueblo called Tebungki, or Fire House,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on the
    prehistoric trail about 25 miles east of Walpi. Between this ruined
    village and the ancestral home there are large and as yet undescribed
    ruins, such as those of the Chaco Canyon, which may once have been
    inhabited by some of these people.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the former shifting of ancient clans, derived from
    legends, is fragmentary, and one way to gain further information and
    revivify forgotten or unrecorded history, is to study the remains of
    their material culture. Architecture is a most important survival, and
    pottery, which has transmitted ancient symbolism unchanged, is also
    valuable. It happens that both these aids characterize the southwestern
    culture areas. Other objects, as stone implements, woven and plaited
    fabrics, and basketry, are not greatly unlike those made by unrelated
    Indians and consequently add little to our knowledge in studies of
    cultures, but architecture and ceramics are distinctive and afford data
    from which we can gather much information on the history of vanished
    races.</p>

  <h2>TEBUNGKI (FIRE HOUSE)</h2>

  <p>Hopi legends of clans whose ancestors once peopled the Sikyatki ruin,
    but are now absorbed in the Walpi population, recount that in their
    western migration they built, near a deep canyon, a village which they
    named Fire House. These legends were first obtained from the Hopi by A.
    M. Stephen and recorded by Victor Mindeleff<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who located Fire House
    ruin over 20 years ago. His valuable description and ground plan, the
    only account heretofore printed, is graphic and substantially correct.
    He calls attention to the characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> or salient points which
    distinguish Fire House from ruined buildings in the Hopi reservation,
    especially its circular or oval form and the massive, well-constructed
    masonry of its walls.</p>

  <figure class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/fig01.jpg" alt="ground plan" id="fig01">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—Fire House.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The exact dimensions of Fire House (<a href="#pl01">pl. 1</a>) can be obtained only by
    excavation, but it is approximately 94 by 79 feet in greater and lesser
    diameter. Some parts of the outside wall are now 10 feet high, and its
    thickness averages 3 feet, but if the stones accumulated about its
    base were removed the height would be 4 or 5 feet greater. There are
    evidences of an external passage-way through the outer wall indicating
    a central court. Within the enclosure there are many indications of
    rooms some of which appear to be circular, but the interior is so
    filled with fallen walls that an accurate ground plan could not be
    drawn without extensive excavation. The stones forming the wall are,
    as a rule, cubical blocks, well dressed and accurately fitted, showing
    good masonry.</p>

  <p>Two of the largest of the wall stones are 5 feet long and 3 feet wide,
    with an estimated thickness of 2 feet. As it would take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> several men
    to carry one of these stones from the quarry to its place in the wall,
    they might be called megaliths.</p>

  <p>The fine spring at the base of the cliff below Fire House was evidently
    used by the inhabitants for drinking water, and the trail from here to
    a gateway in the outer wall is still well marked. As one climbs from
    the spring to the top of the plateau the way passes between the cliff
    and a flat stone set on edge and pierced with a hole about 5 feet above
    the pathway. This stone was evidently a means of defense; behind it the
    warriors may have stood peering down upon their enemies through this
    orifice. Near it are pictographs of unknown meaning.</p>

  <p>The circular form of Fire House (<a href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>) and its well-constructed
    surrounding wall are more characteristic of eastern than of western
    pueblo masonry. This round type<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is found from southern Colorado on
    the north to the neighborhood of the Zuñi settlements on the south; it
    has not been reported from the region on both banks of the Rio Grande.
    Roughly speaking, circular ruins correspond, in their distribution,
    with a line extending north-south midway between the eastern and
    western sections of the pueblo area—a limitation that can hardly be
    regarded as fortuitous. Its meaning we may not be able to correctly
    interpret, but the fact calls for an explanation. The type is old, the
    modern pueblos having abandoned this form. The area where circular
    ruins occur corresponds, in a way, to that inhabited in part by the
    modern Keres, none of whom, however, now dwell in circular towns.
    Provisionally we shall consider the Keresan pueblos as the nearest of
    all descendants of those who once inhabited villages of circular or
    oval form, a generalization substantiated by the existence of words of
    Keres language in many old ceremonies among all the pueblos.</p>

  <p>There is a sharp line of demarcation between the zone of circular ruins
    and that inhabited by the pueblos along the Rio Grande, but on the
    western border these circular buildings extend as far west as the Hopi
    country.</p>

  <p>In attempting to connect the oval form of Fire House with the
    rectangular form of Sikyatki we are met with the difficulty of
    architectural dissimilarity. Fire House is circular, Sikyatki is
    rectangular. If the descendants of the inhabitants of Fire House later
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>constructed Sikyatki, why did they make this radical change in the
    form of their dwellings? They may have constructed a habitation en
    route before they reached Sikyatki, and this village may have had a
    form like Fire House. On the Hopi plateau above Sikyatki there are
    two conical mounds visible for a long distance as one approaches East
    Mesa from the mouth of Keam’s Canyon, which should be considered in
    this connection. These mounds, called Kükütcomo, are connected in
    Hopi legends with those of Sikyatki at the foot of the mesa on which
    they stand, and the buildings they cover are said once to have been
    inhabited by the Coyote (Fire?) clan of eastern kinship. They have not
    been excavated completely but several rooms have been opened up enough
    to show that they are round towers or kivas with rooms annexed to their
    bases. They resemble, in fact, circular ruins and may well have been
    the home of some of the people who abandoned Fire House. They must be
    considered in discussing the reliability of the legend, for they are
    the only circular houses yet reported from the Hopi country. The reason
    why this form of house was abandoned can not be determined with any
    certainty, even though some of the clans from Fire House may have built
    the round towers above Sikyatki. The only other round room known to me
    in the Hopi country, besides Kükütcomo, is one in a ruin in the Oraibi
    Valley mentioned by Victor Mindeleff (<i>op. cit.</i>). The reference
    is very meager and on account of its exceptional character should be
    verified. Assuming the observation as correct it may be said that this
    so-called circular room lies embedded in a mass of rectangular rooms
    and not as kivas in the inhabited Hopi pueblos in the plazas free from
    houses.</p>

  <p>The legends of the Snake people of Walpi who came from the San Juan
    near Navaho Mountain, probably Betatakin or Kitsiel, distinctly state
    that their ancestors built both round and square or “five-cornered”
    houses. The rooms referred to are believed to be kivas, since another
    legend declares the earliest snake ceremonies were performed in
    circular rooms. After visiting Fire House the author desired greatly to
    find other oval ruins between it and the zone of circular ruins, but
    his efforts were not successful.</p>

  <h2>SEARCH FOR HOPI RUINS EAST OF TEBUNGKI</h2>

  <p>After having visited Fire House and verified to his satisfaction that
    it was a former home of a Hopi clan, as recounted in legends of that
    clan, the author sought still further evidence of an archeological
    character in the region east of Fire House, as recorded in migration
    stories. The area between Fire House and Jemez is extensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> and rich
    in ruins of all kinds, open air pueblos predominating. It is too great
    a task to visit all of these ruins during one summer, and the work
    accomplished in a single month seems small, but a beginning was made
    in the hope that the cumulative work of many summers will make it
    important.</p>

  <p>The farther we recede from the Hopi country the more obscure become
    their clan trails, and the more difficult it is to identify the
    localities mentioned in legends. The inhabitants of some of the pueblos
    now in ruins between Jemez and Hopi, may have died out without leaving
    any representatives; others, when they left their village, may have
    gone to Zuñi or elsewhere. In the country east of Fire House, as
    far as Fort Defiance, several ruins were observed, but none of them
    seemed to show close archeological likeness to the oval Fire House,
    or to corroborate the traditions of the descendants of the clans now
    absorbed into the population of Walpi. A large ruin near Ganado was
    visited, and an imperfect sketch made of its ground plan. Its walls are
    so much worn down by the encroachment of the stream on one side, and
    the road on the other, that little could be learned from superficial
    examination. Although it is not a circular ruin like Fire House, yet an
    extended excavation might reveal some interesting details of ceramic
    symbolism<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which would be important.</p>

  <h2>RUINS IN NASHLINI CANYON</h2>

  <p>Two cliff houses of small size were visited in Nashlini Canyon which
    appear to be those casually mentioned by Dr. Prudden,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but, so far as
    known, they have not been described. This canyon is one of the southern
    branches of the Chelly Canyon, and although not very extensive shares
    with it many characteristics. A trip can be made into it by automobile
    as far as the first cliff house.</p>

  <p>The ruin most easily visited (<a href="#fig02">fig. 2</a>) in this canyon is on a
    comparatively low shelf in a shallow cave, 40 feet high, a few feet
    above the top of the talus. Like many other cliff houses it is divided
    into two parts, called the upper and the lower, according to the level
    they occupy. The lower is practically buried under rocks fallen from
    the walls of the upper house. The front wall of the upper part <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>is well
    preserved and closely follows the contour of the low ridge on which
    it stands. The masonry is fairly good, but the floors of the rooms
    are buried under a thick deposit of sheep droppings, solidly packed,
    showing that the enclosures have been used secondarily as corrals for
    these domesticated animals. The partition walls of the rooms end on the
    vertical wall of the precipice, the face of the precipice serving as
    their rear wall. It thus happens that there is no recess between the
    back of the rooms and the rear of the cave, as commonly found in cliff
    dwellings. Circular rooms are absent in the upper part of this ruin,
    and kivas, if any, must be sought buried under the accumulated débris
    of the lower part. The front wall of the upper house measures 64 feet,
    and can be traced throughout its whole extent. At one end of the ruin
    there are four narrow rooms separated by partitions, each containing
    a grinding bin, where maize (corn) was reduced to meal. The remaining
    rooms are roofless, plastered, and evidently used as dwellings. In
    the lower series of rooms, buried beneath a mass of fallen rocks, are
    circular depressions, which may be ceremonial rooms; but no excavations
    were made in these depressions and their significance is unknown.</p>

  <figure class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/fig02.jpg" alt="" id="fig02">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>—Ground plan of cliff ruin in Nashlini
    Canyon.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Another cliff house, a few miles farther up in the canyon, is almost
    hidden in an inaccessible recess of the cliff, but so high that it was
    not visited.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

  <p>On the dizzy top of a cliff overlooking the canyon, near the second
    ruin, artificial walls were observed but not visited. An Indian guide
    claimed that they were towers; they are certainly so situated as to
    permit a wide view up and down the canyon. These walls are mentioned by
    Dr. Prudden.</p>

  <p>On the walls of the canyon not far from the first ruin there is an
    instructive group of pictographs (<a href="#fig03">fig. 3</a>) representing human beings,
    some painted red, others white, standing in three lines. The majority
    have triangular bodies with shoulders prolonged into arms at right
    angles to the body; the forearms hanging from their extremities, as is
    common in this region. On each side of the head are lateral extensions
    recalling the whorls in which Hopi maidens still dress their hair, a
    custom that has passed out of use among the other pueblos, but is still
    preserved in personifying supernatural beings called Katcina maids. It
    appears to have been a universal custom of the unmarried women among
    the cliff dwellers to dress their hair in this fashion. These figures
    are arranged in three rows; three individuals are depicted in the upper
    row, four in the middle, and two in the lower row painted white, unlike
    the others. Below the figures are rows of dots and several parallel
    bars accompanied by a number of zigzag figures like lightning symbols.
    On the supposition that the red figures represent Indian men or women,
    the white figures may be white men and the dots and bars an aboriginal
    count, the whole representing participants in some past event.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

  <h2>CHIN LEE CLIFF HOUSES</h2>

  <p>Along southern tributaries of Chin Lee Valley there are instructive
    cliff houses that have escaped the attention of archeologists. Judging
    from his map, some of these may have been visited by Dr. Prudden for he
    gives a figure of one of the two cliff ruins (<a href="#pl02a">pl. 2, fig. <i>a</i></a>),
    in the Chin Lee, about 40 miles from Chin Lee postoffice. Their state
    of preservation and the character of their sites may be judged from
    the accompanying illustrations. These ruins were not visited, the
    photographs (<a href="#pl02a">pl. 2, figs. <i>a–c</i></a>) having been presented by a Navaho
    Indian, George H. Hoater, who made the pictures but did not know the
    name of the ruin or of the canyon. There are other ruins in the Chin
    Lee canyons, of which information is quite meager.</p>

  <h2>RUINS NEAR GALLUP, NEW MEXICO</h2>

  <p>The geographical position of the country about Gallup renders it a very
    important area in the study of the migration of aboriginal peoples in
    the Southwest. It lies midway between the Rio Grande on the east and
    the Little Colorado on the west, and between the San Juan on the north
    and the Zuñi on the south. In their intercommunication, the trails of
    migration in prehistoric times must have crossed this region, and as
    this migration was marked by successive stages where buildings were
    constructed we should expect here to find remains of former migratory
    peoples. Ruins in the vicinity of Gallup have been so much neglected
    by students that our knowledge of this region is very fragmentary. To
    remedy this condition the author made a few trips in this vicinity
    with Mr. Sanderson and Mr. Bruce Draper, local students, who furnished
    important aid. A number of pueblo sites and small cliff houses within
    a few miles of the city were visited and superficially examined, but
    no intensive work was done upon them. The ruins mentioned below are
    only a few of those in this region that could be brought to light by
    systematic scientific exploration. From his examination of them, it is
    the author’s impression that the majority were inhabited by ancestors
    of clans now domiciled in Zuñi.</p>

  <h2>ZUÑI HILL RUINS</h2>

  <p>This extensive ruin (pl. 3, <a href="#pl03a"><i>a</i></a>, <a href="#pl03c"><i>c</i></a>), 6 miles south from
    Zuñi station on the Santa Fe railroad, and about 11 miles from Gallup,
    lies almost directly opposite a conspicuous pinnacle of Wingate
    sandstone called the Navaho Church. Its site is a low ridge extending
    north and south for several hundred yards. None of the walls rise above
    the mounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> which are highest on the west side. There are numerous
    depressions scattered among the mounds which suggest subterranean rooms
    of circular form. A round depression 40 feet in diameter shows the
    remnant of a wall on one side. On a “flat” north of the ruin several
    piles of stone can be seen, which are interpreted as isolated houses;
    near one of them is a small fireplace made of slabs of rock set on edge
    surrounding an enclosure filled with ashes. This is without exception
    the largest cluster of mounds in the immediate neighborhood of Gallup,
    and would well repay excavation and further study.</p>

  <h2>KIT CARSON GROUP</h2>

  <p>This group of mounds has received its name from Kit Carson Spring which
    lies in their neighborhood. It is situated north of Navaho Church on an
    elevation overlooking the road from Gallup to Crown Point. The members
    of the group are numerous, but each mound is comparatively small. In
    no case were walls found rising above the mounds, but as nearly as
    could be judged from their shape, the buildings covered had rectangular
    outlines and were accompanied by circular depressions. Fifty feet south
    of the largest mound of this group there is a semicircular pile of
    rocks which measures 42 feet on the south side, and with a radius of
    30 feet from this side to the curved wall. The main ruin has lateral
    extensions on the north and south ends, and measures 70 feet by 41
    feet. The lateral extensions give the mounds the shape of the letter
    <span class="sans">E</span> and enclose a square room of rectangular form measuring 20 by
    15 feet.</p>

  <h2>RUINS IN HEMLOCK CANYON</h2>

  <p>Hemlock Canyon, north of the road from Gallup to Crown Point, has
    the general features of other canyons in this neighborhood. At its
    mouth there are fertile fields, and a good spring which a Navaho has
    appropriated by building a hogan and fencing off the entrance. About
    a half mile from this spring following the right bank of the arroyo,
    which rarely contains water, there is a house (<a href="#pl11a">pl. 11, <i>a</i></a>) built
    in a recess of the cliff about 10 feet above small scrub trees which
    here grow in abundance. Its foundation is about 6 feet long, and the
    wall is slightly curved and well constructed, showing a doorway shaped
    like the letter <span class="sans">T</span>. This house is not regarded as a dwelling, for
    it is too small for a family, and no household implements have been
    found within the enclosure. It belongs rather to a type of cave-house
    called “ledge rooms,” many examples of which occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> near larger
    dwellings. It was probably a storeroom, although possibly a retreat
    where priests retired to pray for rain, as was once the custom among
    the Hopi. The people to whom this house belonged probably dwelt near
    their farms a short distance from the base of the cliff. There is a
    similar room known to have been constructed by Navahos a few feet off
    the road from Gallup to Crown Point, which is still used for a granary,
    indicating the probable use of the small building here described.</p>

  <h2>RUINS NEAR BLACK DIAMOND RANCH</h2>

  <p>Black Diamond Ranch is 13 miles north of Hosta Butte. Mr. Bruce Draper,
    who owns the ranch, pointed out near the mouth of a neighboring canyon
    several comparatively large ruins. In one of the largest of these (<a href="#pl03b">pl.
    3, <i>b</i></a>) near the ranch house, no walls are visible above ground,
    but the surface presents abundant evidence of a buried ruin. In one
    corner of this ruin (<a href="#pl03b">pl. 3, <i>b</i></a>) Mr. Bruce dug out a small room
    which has good plastered walls, several feet high, and found decorative
    bowls, some of which are here figured (figs. <a href="#fig04">4</a>, <a href="#fig05">5</a>). About 50 feet south
    of this ruin, a low mound suggests a cemetery, and about the same
    distance still farther south, a depression on the surface indicates a
    circular subterranean room or reservoir.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>—Spherical bowl, Black Diamond Ranch. 7⅜
      by 5 inches.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Following up this canyon nearly to its head, there is a small ruin
    hardly worth mentioning save for a spiral incised pictograph 3 feet in
    diameter identical with the snake symbols widely distributed throughout
    the Southwest.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

  <p>In all the region north of the high ridge of eroded Wingate sandstone
    there are several other groups of ruins with most of the walls very
    much broken down. It would probably be conservative to state that there
    were over 200 ruins, large and small, in this region, showing evidence
    of a considerable population, if they were inhabited simultaneously.
    Fragments of pottery occur on almost every ridge overlooking the
    trails, especially along the road from Gallup to Crown Point. The forms
    of these ruins vary and can be made out only by systematic excavation.</p>

      by 4½ inches.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>So far as limited exploration about Gallup has gone, the investigations
    by the author show that the ruins were inhabited by Zuñi clans, as
    indicated in the structure of the buildings and the symbols on the
    pottery. It would be important to determine the relative age of
    these ruins compared with those about Zuñi; as to whether they were
    peopled by colonies from Zuñi, or whether their inhabitants joined the
    Zuñi population after deserting these houses. Although there is not
    sufficient evidence to prove the latter proposition, the author is
    inclined to accept it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

  <h2>CROWN POINT RUINS</h2>

  <p>No more interesting question in southwestern archeology awaits an
    answer than the query: What became of the former inhabitants of the
    Chaco ruins, one of the largest clusters of deserted buildings in
    New Mexico? Like the cliff dwellers of the Mesa Verde, their former
    inhabitants have disappeared and left no clue as to where they went,
    the date of their occupation of the ruins, or their kinship with
    other peoples. Existing legends relating to them among supposed
    descendants who are thought to live in modern pueblos are fragmentary
    and knowledge of their archeology is defective. The Hyde Expedition
    made an extraordinary collection of artifacts from Pueblo Bonito, the
    largest and formerly the best preserved ruin of the group, but the
    excavations there have yielded little information on the kinship of
    its inhabitants. Until we know more about the Chaco Canyon ruins we
    are justified in the belief that there still remains a most important
    problem for the archeologist to solve.</p>

  <p>In seeking the prehistoric migration trail of the Hopi before they came
    to Fire House, the author examined ruins near Crown Point identical
    with those of the Chaco Canyon. There are in fact two ruins within a
    few miles of the Crown Point Indian school, one of them known among
    the Navaho Indians as Kin-a-a (the name of the other unknown to the
    author), which are structurally members of the Chaco series.</p>

  <p>The ground plan of the largest, Kin-a-a,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is rectangular and was
    apparently oriented north and south, the walls on the north side
    being the highest and best preserved and those on the south possibly
    terraced. On the south side remnants of a court or enclosure surrounded
    by a low wall can still be detected. The ruin is compact with embedded
    kivas and measures approximately 150 feet long by 100 feet wide, the
    north walls rising in places to 50 feet, showing good evidences of
    five stories, one above the other. The high walls reveal rooms of
    rectangular shape. Situated midway in the length of the north wall (pl.
    4, <a href="#pl04a"><i>a</i></a>, <a href="#pl04b"><i>b</i></a>, <a href="#pl04c"><i>c</i></a>) is a circular chamber like a kiva on
    the ground floor, with high walls about it. The recesses between the
    wall of the circular room and the rectangular wall enclosing it are
    solidly filled in with masonry, a mode of construction adopted in the
    great ruins of the Chaco Canyon. The kiva of Kin-a-a (pl. 5, <a href="#pl05a"><i>a</i></a>,
    <a href="#pl05b"><i>b</i></a>), <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>like those of the great building of the same canyon, are
    built into the mass of rooms and not separated from them as in the
    modern pueblos, Walpi, those of the Rio Grande, and the ruin of Sun
    Temple on the Mesa Verde. This separation of the kiva from the house
    mesa is regarded by the author as a late evolution, being unknown among
    the cliff dwellers, and very rare in pueblo ruins possessing ancient
    characteristics. A union or huddling together of sacred and secular
    rooms is characteristic of the period when each kiva was limited to
    the performance of clan rites, the separation of the kiva from secular
    rooms marking the development of a fraternity of priests composed of
    different clans. The diameter of the kiva in Kin-a-a is about 15 feet,
    the average size of these rooms, no doubt determined by the length of
    logs available for roofs. When the diameter is greater than that it
    is customary to make the roof in a vaulted form by utilizing shorter
    roofing, but kivas as small as 10 feet in diameter were sometimes
    roofed by vaulting. Depressions, in mounds, measuring as much as 50
    feet in diameter, in ruins in the Montezuma Valley have been identified
    as circular ceremonial rooms, but as these have not been excavated,
    there is always a doubt, for instead of being ceremonial and roofed
    they may have been uncovered reservoirs for storage of water, for not
    all circular depressions are kivas. In Far View Pueblo,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in the Mummy
    Lake Group, the author excavated a kiva 32 feet in diameter, which was
    found to have pilasters for a vaulted roof. No such pilasters occur in
    Kin-a-a, showing that the roof was flat with a central hatchway, as is
    customary in all these rooms with two or more stories.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to explain the enclosed space above the kiva in this
    ruin. Was it occupied by rooms one above another, or was the lower
    open to the sky? The rows of holes interpreted as indicating floors
    is without significance, unless there were a number of superposed
    rooms. It must be remembered that the ceremonial room or kiva, in
    modern mythology, represents the underworld out of which, according
    to legends, the early races of men emerged through an opening in the
    roof or hatchway. Among the Hopi it is never covered by another room,
    and this is carried so far that it is forbidden to walk on a roof
    of a kiva, especially at a time when rites are being performed.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
    Such an act would be regarded as sacrilegious, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>and the same taboo
    is now probably universal: consequently walls constructed 40 feet
    above the top of the kiva, showing evidence of rooms superposed in
    stories, are exceptional. The object of rooms above a kiva can only be
    surmised; possibly there may have been four kivas, one above another,
    to represent the underworlds in which the ancestors of the human
    race lived in succession before emerging into that in which we now
    dwell. The inner walls of this kiva are shown in <a href="#pl05a">plate 5, <i>a</i></a>.
    It was evident to the author when examining the inner wall of the
    superposed room, above that identified as the kiva, that it belonged to
    a room with a roof, as appears also from the view here given (<a href="#pl05a">pl. 5,
    <i>a</i></a>). Whatever explanation of this exceptional condition may be
    suggested, we cannot question the fact that here we have remains of a
    kiva below one or more other rooms.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p>A well blazed trail passes the ruin and is lost in the distant hills.
    This trail was at first mistaken for an irrigation ditch, but an
    examination of its course shows that it runs up a steep hill, which
    precludes such a theory. It is a section of an old Indian trail,
    indications of which occur elsewhere in the State, a pathway over which
    the rocks used in the construction of the ruins were transported. A
    similar trail used for a like purpose is recorded near the great ruin
    at Aztec, New Mexico.</p>

  <h2>RUIN B NEAR CROWN POINT</h2>

  <p>Ruin B (pl. 6, <a href="#pl06a"><i>a</i></a>, <a href="#pl06b"><i>b</i></a>), largely made up of a kiva of
    circular form within a rectangular enclosure, lies near Crown Point
    on top of a low plateau, back from the edge. Its name is unknown to
    the author, but from its size and the character of its masonry it
    must formerly have been of considerable importance. It was not, like
    Kin-a-a, included in the President’s proclamation making the Chaco
    Canyon ruins a National Monument. The appearance of the masonry and the
    structure of the circular room, identified as a kiva, leads the author
    to place it in the same class as the Chaco ruins, its nearest neighbor
    being Kin-a-a, east of Crown Point. The excavation of this ruin might
    shed instructive light on the extension or migration of the inhabitants
    of the Chaco, after they left their homes in that canyon.</p>

  <p>A ground plan of this ruin (<a href="#fig06">fig. 6</a>) shows that the standing walls are
    rectangular and practically surround a circular room or kiva. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>The
    walls are double, the interval between the inner wall and that of the
    circular chamber being filled in with solid masonry.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The outer of
    the two enclosing rectangular walls is separated from the inner by an
    interval of about 7 feet, and is connected with it by thin partitions,
    somewhat analogous to those described as connecting the two concentric
    walls<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of circular towers on the McElmo.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>—Ground plan of ruined kiva near Crown
      Point.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>No other walls were observed above ground in this ruin, although
    small piles of stone were noticed which may have been walls of other
    buildings. The reason why the walls about the kiva have been preserved
    so much longer than those of neighboring secular chambers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> is probably
    because of the universal care exercised by man in the construction of
    the walls of religious buildings.</p>

  <h2>POTTERY</h2>

  <figure class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
    <img class="illowp60" src="images/fig07.jpg" alt="" id="fig07">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—Decorated handled cup, Black Diamond
      Ranch. 5½ by 4 inches.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Brief mention of ceramic objects found in the area considered in this
    review is here introduced because they substantiate the evidences of
    the buildings concerning the relationship of prehistoric people in
    this neighborhood. Moreover, they add to our limited knowledge of the
    arts in a little-known area. Very little has been recorded concerning
    pottery from the ruins near Gallup, but the few known specimens do not
    bear a sufficiently specialized symbolism to separate them from others
    found in different geographical areas. Evidently no distinctive ceramic
    area was developed in this region. Attention, however, may be called
    to the fact that the symbols on pottery (<a href="#fig07">fig. 7</a>) represent the oldest
    types, and that geometrical designs rather than conventional animal
    figures predominate. The pottery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> suggests Zuñi ware, but is radically
    different from modern Zuñi and has different symbols, showing, as far
    as it goes, that settlements in which it occurs were made prior to the
    development of modern Zuñi ceramic decorations which were influenced by
    them. It has a likeness to old Zuñi ware, but has a closer resemblance
    to fragments from the Crown Point Ruin, and the Chaco settlements,
    which is significant.</p>

  <figure class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
    <img class="illowp60" src="images/fig08.jpg" alt="" id="fig08">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>—Cooking pot, Black Diamond Ranch. 7½ by
      6 inches.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Perhaps the most exceptional specimens obtained during the author’s
    trip are two large, black jars (<a href="#fig08">fig. 8</a>), their color recalling Santa
    Clara ware. The decoration on these jars takes the form of designs on
    a raised zigzag band meandering about their necks, similar to pottery
    used by the Navaho Indians. The informant, a reliable white man, claims
    they are not Navaho work, and showed the locality near a ruined ancient
    wall where he excavated them. He also reports a portion of a human
    skeleton found in the same neighborhood which affords good indication
    that they were mortuary, while the position of the grave would show
    that they were deposited by the same people who inhabited the room
    near by. The question is pertinent, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> whether they were not a
    modern secondary burial; but if we accept this theory it indicates an
    unusual condition, for the Navaho seldom bury their pottery as mortuary
    offerings.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>The author noticed, especially in his examination of the mounds near
    Kit Carson Spring, certain foundation walls indicating small, circular,
    buildings strung along in a row on the tops of ridges. One or two of
    these suggest a round ruin near Zuñi, and seem to afford the missing
    link in the prehistoric chain of settlements connecting the great
    Chaco ruins<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> with some of those in Zuñi valley. These important
    similarities are supported by the traditions of the Zuñi that some of
    their ancestors once inhabited the buildings on the Chaco; and the fact
    that certain ruins, among them Kintiel, north of Navaho Springs, are
    definitely claimed by the Zuñi to have been inhabited by their Corn
    clan.</p>

  <figure class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
    <img class="illowp73" src="images/fig09.jpg" alt="" id="fig09">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>—Decorative food bowl, Black Diamond
      Ranch. 7 by 3 inches.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The black and white pottery, found about Gallup, is identical with
    that of the latter ruin, and very similar to that generally found in
    the earliest epoch of pueblo occupancy. As pointed out in an article
    on Zuñi pottery, in the “Putnam Anniversary Volume,” modern Zuñi
    pottery is so different from the ancient that we can hardly regard
    it as evolved from it. The same is true among the Hopi; the modern
    pottery decoration is not like the old, but is Tewa. Hopi-Tewa pottery
    is largely the work of Nampeo, who once decorated her pottery solely
    with Tewa symbols instead of old Hopi. In 1895 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>she abandoned the Tewa
    symbols of her people to meet a demand for old pottery and substituted
    for Tewa designs copies of ancient Hopi pottery from Sikyatki. Thus
    there have been two radical changes in the style of Hopi pottery since
    1710; one the substitution of Tewa designs for old Hopi, the other
    a return to Sikyatki motifs within the last 20 years. This modern
    innovation, however, has not been derived from the ancient by any
    evolution, but by acculturation. Possibly a similar change has taken
    place at Zuñi, calling for caution in supposing that pottery found in
    the refuse heaps is necessarily evolved from that preexisting or found
    in strata below it.</p>

  <figure class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
    <img class="illowp60" src="images/fig10.jpg" alt="" id="fig10">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>—Decorated handled cup, Black Diamond
      Ranch. 6⅜ by 5¼ inches.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The author has seen no evidence that would lead him to abandon the
    theory, that the Zuñi valley was once peopled by clans related to those
    on Little Colorado derived from the Gila, and that other clans drifted
    into the valley from the north at a later date. These later additions
    were from the circular ruin belt. Later came Tewa clans as the Asa of
    the Hopi, and others. The author finds more evidences of acculturation
    than autochthonous evolution in modern Zuñi, as in modern Hopi ceramic
    symbols. Pottery (figs. <a href="#fig09">9</a>, <a href="#fig10">10</a>) found in ruins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> about Gallup belongs
    to the same type as that from Kintiel which Cushing, from legendary
    evidences, found to have been settled by Zuñi clans.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

  <h2>RUINS IN HILL CANYON</h2>

  <p>The country directly south of Ouray, Utah, is an unknown land to
    the archeologist. Geologically speaking it is a very rugged region,
    composed of eroded cliffs and deep canyons which up to within a few
    years has been so difficult of access that white men have rarely
    ventured into it. At present the country is beginning to be settled
    and there are a few farms where the canyon broadens enough to afford
    sufficient arable land for the needs of agriculture. The canyon is
    very picturesque, the cliffs on either side rising from its narrow bed
    by succession of natural steps (<a href="#pl07a">pl. 7, <i>a</i></a>) formed of sandstone
    outcrops alternating with soft, easily eroded cretaceous rock. Its
    many lateral contributing canyons are of small size, but extend deep
    into the mountain in the recesses of which are said to be hidden many
    isolated cave shelters, and other prehistoric remains. The cliffs and
    canyons of this region are not unlike those farther south along the
    Green and the Grand Rivers, a description of which, quoted from Prof.
    Newberry,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> pictures vividly the appearance of the weird scenery in
    these canyons. He says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>From this point the view swept westward over a wide extent of
      country in its general aspect a plane, but everywhere deeply cut by
      a tangled maze of canyons and thickly set with towers, castles, and
      spires of varied and striking forms; the most wonderful monuments
      of erosion which our eyes already experienced in objects of this
      kind had beheld. Near the mesa we are leaving stand detached
      portions of it of every possible form from broad, flat tables, to
      slender cones, crowned with pinnacles of the massive sandstone
      which forms the perpendicular faces of the walls of the Colorado.
      These castellated groups are from 1,000 to 5,000 feet in height,
      and no language is adequate to convey a just idea of the strange
      and impressive scenery formed by their grand and varied outlines.
      Their appearance was so strange and beautiful as to call out
      exclamations of delight from our party.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In this wild country up to his time rarely visited by white men, Prof.
    Newberry also graphically described ruins not greatly unlike some of
    those in Hill Canyon as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Some two miles below the head of Labyrinth Canyon we came upon the
      ruins of a large number of houses of stone. Evidently built by the
      Pueblo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> Indians as they are similar to those on the Dolores, and
      the pottery scattered about is identical with that before found in
      so many places. It is very old but of excellent quality made of red
      clay coated with white and handsomely figured. Here the houses are
      built in sides of the cliffs. A mile or two below we saw others
      crowning the inaccessible summits, inaccessible except by ladders,
      of picturesque detached buttes of red sandstone, which rise to
      the height of 150 feet above the bottom of the canyon. Similar
      buildings were found lower down and broken pottery was picked up
      upon the summits of the cliffs overhanging Grand River. Evidence
      that these dreadful canyons were once the homes of families
      belonging to that great people who formerly spread over all this
      region now so utterly sterile, solitary and desolate.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Prof. Montgomery,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in an article on the ruins in Nine Mile Canyon,
    gives a description of similar prehistoric remains which he had found
    in that region. From this description the author of the present paper
    supposes that these ruins belong to the same type or one very similar
    to those found in Hill Canyon. The antiquities Montgomery mentions are
    well preserved, for he speaks of one of the towers in this region as
    about 50 feet high, standing in an almost inaccessible spot commanding
    a magnificent view of several canyons and mountains. He says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>On the top of a mesa in an extremely dizzy situation, were the
      remains of three small stone circular structures, two of which were
      provided with roofs of heavy cedar logs and heavy, flat stones.
      The logs and poles of these two structures would make about a cord
      of wood, and they possessed distinct marks of the rude stone axes
      with which they had been cut into suitable lengths. * * * On the
      south side of the canyon, and about a mile from Brock’s Postoffice,
      I explored a strong and well-built stone structure, which stood
      upon a high and precipitous cliff. It formed about the two-thirds
      of a circle, being 14 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 5½ feet high,
      and was completed by a cliff in its rear. * * * In a short time
      we came to the rock column, which, although hard and solid was
      much disintegrated and had been vertically cleft and separated,
      leaving a dangerous gap between its two inclined and overhanging
      portions. By the aid of cedar poles we succeeded in clambering to
      its summit, and there, in a situation that commanded a magnificent
      view of many canyons and hills, we found the ruin of four circular
      stone structures which, in my opinion had once been a look-out, and
      signal military station. They were arranged upon the flat top of
      the rock in such a manner that three smaller ones, each capable of
      holding but one man, occupied the front and most exposed places,
      one of them being in advance of the other two, which were nearer
      the sides of the rock. The fourth and largest stone structure held
      a place several yards in the rear of the three small ones, but from
      it a clear view of a wide and extended tract of country could also
      be obtained. They were all destitute of openings except at the top,
      and their walls sloped inward from below, so that the opening in
      each of the three small structures was small and only sufficient to
      allow the entrance or exit of one person.</p>

  <p>The author’s attention was called to ruins in Hill Canyon like those
    above mentioned, by Mr. A. H. Kneale, agent of the Utes at Fort
    Duchesne, Utah, and at the close of work at Mesa Verde a trip was
    made into the region where they are found. The route was from Grand
    Junction, Colorado, to Mack, Utah, by rail, thence by rail to the end
    of the road at Watson. The trip from Watson to Ouray was by automobile.
    At Ouray the author outfitted with wagon, forded the Duchesne River,
    and crossed the Green River by ferry. Later he proceeded south to Squaw
    Crossing on Willow Creek, and thence to Taylor’s ranch, in the midst of
    the ruins of Hill Canyon.</p>

  <p>The ruins mentioned below were visited, but many others were reported
    by cowboys which were not seen on account of limitation in time, the
    object of the visit being primarily a reconnoissance.</p>

  <p>The following ruins were seen by the author and his companions during
    their short visit to this region:</p>

  <p>1. Ruins <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, on the canyon rim within sight of
    Taylor’s lower ranch.</p>

  <p>2. Two ruins on pinnacles of rocks 1½ miles from Taylor’s lower ranch
    following the canyon southward.</p>

  <p>3. Tower ruin crowning a leaning pinnacle.</p>

  <p>4. Ruin on top of a plateau with precipitous sides, in middle of a
    canyon 3 miles south of Taylor’s lower ranch.</p>

  <p>5. Walls on top of an inverted cone, 6 miles up the canyon from
    Taylor’s lower ranch.</p>

  <p>6. Several towers in a cluster on a point of the plateau 8 miles below
    Taylor’s lower ranch.</p>

  <p>The above ruins may be classified into two types distinguished by the
    character of their site: (a) True “mushroom rock ruins,” as their name
    implies, are perched on tops of isolated rock pinnacles resembling the
    so-called Snake rock at Walpi, and (b) the second type, crown spurs of
    the mesa overlooking the canyon. The pinnacle foundations of the former
    are the last stage in erosion of a spur from the side of the canyon. It
    is doubtful whether these pinnacles were cut off by erosion before or
    after the buildings thereon were constructed. On the whole both types
    of ruins in Hill Canyon present no architectural differences from those
    found in some of the tributary canyons of the Colorado River.</p>

  <p>The author’s visit to the Hill Canyon region was mainly a
    reconnoissance to verify reports of the existence of prehistoric
    remains in this little-known region. He was accompanied by Mr. T. G.
    Lemmon of Dallas, Texas, a volunteer, who furnished the Hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> Canyon
    pictures here reproduced. Mr. Owen, the official farmer of the Ute
    reservation, and an Indian boy accompanied us, the former as guide, the
    latter as driver. In penetrating this secluded country we were obliged
    to camp along the way, but were hospitably received by the few ranchmen
    along the route and made our home for a few days at Taylor’s lower
    ranch while making our excursions to the ruins. It is a great pleasure
    to acknowledge this aid and especially that of Mr. Kneale, who aided us
    in outfitting at Ouray.</p>

  <p>The best preserved examples of characteristic Hill Canyon Ruins
    belong to the second type, or those not isolated from the neighboring
    plateau, the most striking of which belong to the mushroom type.
    Both have a general similarity in circular form and massive walls,
    recalling, except in poor quality of masonry the so-called “towers”
    of the McElmo Canyon. They resemble the “Tower ruin,” found by Prof.
    Montgomery, in Nine Mile Canyon, on the western slope of the range.
    Their masonry is composed of natural slabs of rock, rudely fashioned by
    fracture, but rarely dressed in cubical blocks, as in the towers on the
    McElmo Canyon. Their exposure to the elements has led to considerable
    destruction, the adobe in which the walls were laid having been washed
    out of the joints. The lower courses of stone, as seen in the view
    of the large ruin perched high above the ranch house, were of larger
    stones than the upper, and showed more evidences of having been dressed
    than the flat stones piled one on the other, which form the upper
    courses.</p>

  <h2>RUINS NEAR TAYLOR’S LOWER RANCH</h2>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Ruin A</span></h3>

  <figure class="figcenter">
    <img class="illowp92" src="images/fig11.jpg" alt="" id="fig11">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>—Ground plan of ruin A, Hill Canyon,
    Utah.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The two large buildings near Taylor’s lower ranch, ruins A and B, are
    typical of the first group, the most conspicuous of which, ruin A, is
    shown in the accompanying figures (<a href="#pl07b">pl. 7, <i>b</i></a>, <a href="#pl08a">pl. 8, <i>a</i></a>).
    This ruin stands on the point of a high cliff, inaccessible except
    on the west side. Although the special features of the masonry are
    somewhat obscured by fallen sections, and the form (<a href="#fig05">fig. 5</a>) is hidden,
    it is a circular enclosure about 25 feet in diameter, its wall being
    about 13 feet high, at the highest point. Between this high outer
    wall (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>) and that of the inner circle, there are remains of a
    banquette or bench, surrounding the chamber very much broken down. The
    lower stones are much larger than the upper, similar in this respect to
    the walls of certain cliff dwellings. The circular room and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
    bench once covered the point of the mesa, and is separated from the
    plateau by a deep fissure worn in the rock outside the wall on that
    side. The height of the highest wall is 20 feet, and the bench around
    the circular portion averages 3 feet high. In thickness the walls
    vary from 1 to 3 feet. On the second ledge, or outcrop of hard rock
    below the summit of the cliff, on which ruin A stands, there is a fine
    example of the dug-out type of habitation, several of which occur in
    the sides of this canyon. The roof of this type of dug-out is formed by
    a flat slab of rock projecting horizontally from the cliff and forming
    the protection for a chamber excavated in the soft rock below. In some
    instances these dugouts have rudely constructed lateral and front walls
    but none of them has more than one room. They appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> to have been
    inhabited rooms but may at times have served for shelter.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Ruin B</span></h3>

  <figure class="figcenter">
    <img class="illowp73" src="images/fig12.jpg" alt="" id="fig12">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—Ground plan of ruin B.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Ruin B (pls. <a href="#pl07b">7</a>, <a href="#pl08b">8</a>, <i>b</i>) is a better preserved example of the tower
    type and is on a ridge considerably lower than that on which ruin A
    stands extending at right angles. It occupies a narrow space from the
    rim of Hill Canyon on one side to a rim of a tributary canyon, blocking
    the passageway along the surface of the ridge to its point. This
    structure (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>) would appear to be structurally not unlike ruin A,
    but with the wall smaller. There is a raised bench on the south side,
    the tower itself being a semi-circular chamber annexed to the north
    side, which extends from one canyon rim to another. The breadth of this
    semi-circular room is 10 feet. The longest dimension is 31 feet and the
    average height of its wall is 4 feet. The top of the wall, throughout,
    is unevenly broken down, the part adjoining the bench being the best
    preserved. The structure suggests a fort, for it would not be possible
    to pass between this obstructing ruin without entering it through a
    circular doorway, the walls of which still stand on the east side.
    There is no passage between the wall and the mesa edge.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>
  <h3><span class="smcap">Long Mesa Ruin</span></h3>

    <img class="illowp33" src="images/fig13.jpg" alt="" id="fig13">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>—Ground plan of towers on Long Mesa.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>On the flat top of a long and narrow mesa (pl. 9, <a href="#pl09a"><i>a</i></a>, <a href="#pl09b"><i>b</i></a>)
    rising about 200 feet from the middle of Hill Creek Canyon a few miles
    above Taylor’s ranch, there is a cluster of three circular ruins, whose
    walls are composed of well constructed masonry, now much dilapidated.
    The surface of this plateau, near the end looking down the canyon, is
    partitioned off from the remainder by a low transverse wall, extending
    from one side to the other. This wall was built advantageously for
    defense and apparently designed to prevent passage of foes from the
    upper end of the plateau into the area where the circular rooms are
    situated. About midway in its length it has a passageway, the jambs of
    which are still visible. Three circular ruins (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>) make up the
    cluster on the lower end of the mesa, each averaging about 15 feet in
    diameter, all constructed of low walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> of stones dressed into proper
    shape. These buildings are not connected but separated by intervals.
    The tops of the walls for several feet have fallen, exposing interiors
    which are almost completely filled with stones and rubble.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter">
    <img class="illowp54" src="images/fig14.jpg" alt="" id="fig14">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>—Ground plan of Eight Mile Ruin.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Eight Mile Ruin</span></h3>

  <p>Eight Mile Ruin (<a href="#pl10a">pl. 10</a>) is the largest and most conspicuous of the
    Hill Creek remains. It consists of a cluster of towers on a cliff
    overlooking the right side of the canyon below Taylor’s ranch and from
    the bottom of the canyon resembles a single large building. It is made
    up of several circular towers, with passageways between which preserve
    all the typical features of this style of ruins. When this cluster is
    examined individually it is found to be composed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> round rooms, a
    semi-circular building, and a rectangular room (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>). The basal
    courses of the masonry are constructed of massive, almost megalithic,
    rocks. The walls of the rectangular building are particularly well
    made, and enclose a room filled to the top with clay mixed with fallen
    rubble. The longest side of this room extends north and south. The
    whole cluster is approximately 70 feet in length. The diameter of the
    circular rooms varies, the outside measurement of the larger ones being
    about 20 feet, while the smallest is barely large enough for a man to
    stand in with comfort. The semi-circular room is 14 feet in diameter.
    The axis of these rooms extends approximately in a north-south
    direction. So far as could be traced each of the larger circular ruins
    has on the inside an elevated banquette surrounding it, and enclosed in
    a wall, reaching a height of 10 feet. There is much fallen rock within
    these enclosures concealing their floors and rendering it impossible to
    trace properly the course of the banquette or interpret its relation.
    Another ruin of the same general plan, but smaller, is a little farther
    down on the same side of the canyon. Its walls have tumbled almost to
    their foundations, and are inconspicuous, resembling piles of stone.</p>

  <p>The essential architectural feature of the Hill Canyon towers is their
    circular form, modified in many instances by the addition of a straight
    wall or rectangular annex. In certain cases the enclosing walls of
    two towers have fused, while in the Eight Mile Ruin the towers are
    accompanied by a rectangular room separated a short distance from them.</p>

  <p>None of these towers show any evidences of past habitation and, what is
    remarkable, no fragments of pottery occur on the surface of the plateau
    in their neighborhood. Not far from the tower (<a href="#pl10a">pl. 10, <i>a</i></a>), there
    was picked up a mealing stone similar to those used by pueblo Indians
    in grinding corn, but no accompanying metate was found. No excavations
    were attempted.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Mushroom Rock Ruins</span></h3>

  <p>The structure of the ruins of the mushroom rock type is not radically
    different from that of the towers above described, they being
    exceptional only in their unusual sites. They occur on top of eroded
    pillars of rock, often enlarged on top, reminding one of mushrooms,
    like the so-called Snake rock at Walpi. They were once extensions or
    spurs of the mesa but are now rock pillars cut off by erosion so that
    they stand out isolated from the rim of the canyon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> On account of the
    difficulty in reaching their tops, the ground plan of many could not be
    observed, but with a glass it was seen that as a rule they conform to
    the shape of the rim of the rock on which they stand. Considering the
    unusual sites of these inaccessible buildings, the question naturally
    arises, How could the ancient dwellers enter these rooms? Had they
    ladders or ropes, or were footholes cut in the side of the cliff to aid
    them? If the theory of footholes be correct we may suppose that these
    have been worn away, for no trace of them could be found.</p>

  <p>A geological question might likewise suggest itself to anyone seeing
    the evidences of erosion between the cliffs and pinnacles. Has the gap
    between the latter and the edge of the plateaux been ploughed out by
    the water since the building on the former were constructed? Although
    the cliffs show that the amount of the erosion has been enormous, it
    must be borne in mind that the prevailing rock is soft sandstone, the
    wearing away of which would not necessarily require a great period of
    time. It is not probable that these pinnacles have been separated by
    erosion from the cliff since man constructed the walls upon them, but
    this question involves the knowledge of a geological expert.</p>

  <p>To the same group of ruins as the mushroom type belongs one from a
    wholly different locality, shown in <a href="#pl12a">plate 12, <i>a</i></a>, a photograph
    of which was given the author by Mr. Chubbock. In this case the ruin
    is not built on top of a rock pinnacle, in the shape of an inverted
    cone, but in the horizontal fissure or constriction worn out under the
    harder stratum above it. The building in this cleft is in fact a kind
    of cliff house in which the front wall extends from top to bottom of
    the crevice, the rooms occupying a recess back of this wall. A somewhat
    similar form of habitation found in the side of a cliff has been
    described by the author.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It was discovered in the Verde Valley,
    Arizona, near Jordan’s ranch, about 6 miles from Jerome, Arizona. In
    his description it is classified as a “ledge house,” a type where the
    opening into the cave is completely walled up. Unlike a true cliff
    dwelling the rooms occupy the whole of a natural cave the top of which
    is its roof. It is not possible to determine from the illustration
    here shown whether or not the recess has been enlarged by artificial
    means, and as the author has not visited the ruin he has no idea of the
    arrangement of rooms.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Inverted Cone Ruin</span></h3>

  <figure class="figcenter">
    <img class="illowp73" src="images/fig15.jpg" alt="" id="fig15">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>—Inverted cone ruin.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The best example of the mushroom type of ruin, shown in the
    accompanying figure (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>) is about 6 miles up the canyon from
    Taylor’s ranch on the right hand side of Hill Canyon. It is clearly
    visible from the road which follows the stream and has a wide outlook
    up and down the valley. Although the top of the rock on which this
    ruin stands would at first sight appear to be inaccessible, Mr. Owen,
    by means of a log, surmounted it and reported that its surface is flat
    and that the walls thereon are about 20 feet long and five feet wide,
    enclosing a roughly oval chamber, as their outline follows the rim of
    the top of the rock. These walls, when seen from the road with a good
    glass, appear as low ridges constructed of indifferent masonry.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Twin Towers</span></h3>

  <figure class="figcenter">
    <img class="illowp73" src="images/fig16.jpg" alt="" id="fig16">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>—Mushroom rock ruins.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Twin pinnacles, shown in figure 16, were observed from the road about 3
    miles up the canyon from Taylor’s ranch. Fragments of walls existed on
    top of both of these pinnacles, but as it was impossible to reach them
    on account of the erosion at their bases the form and condition of the
    walls were impossible to determine. Like the tower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> last mentioned, the
    view from their tops stretches several miles in both directions up and
    down the canyon.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Ruin on Leaning Pinnacle</span></h3>

  <p>The author’s limited visit to this region made it impossible to record
    all the various shapes of eroded pinnacles bearing buildings found in
    Hill Canyon, but one of the most remarkable of these foundations was
    observed to lean very perceptibly to one side (<a href="#pl13">pl. 13</a>) so that one side
    of the ruin barely falls within the line of stable equilibrium. The
    top of this leaning pinnacle was inaccessible, the height being about
    50 feet from the base, which rose from a narrow ridge over 200 feet
    above the plain. The author’s idea of the ground plan and character
    of the masonry in this ruin is limited to what could be seen from the
    road, but its general appearance from that distance is the same as the
    preceding ruin.</p>

  <p>In this account the author has mentioned a few of the more prominent
    mushroom rock ruins, confining himself to those which can be observed
    in a hurried visit to the canyon. It is undoubtedly true, as reported
    by several cowboys, that the side canyons, difficult of access,
    concealed many others which a longer visit would bring to light. The
    characteristics of the ruin crowned pinnacles, or leaning buttresses of
    rock in Hill Canyon are shown in <a href="#pl13">plate 13</a>.</p>

  <h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>

  <p>As artifacts were not found in or near the buildings on the Hill Canyon
    cliffs, and as the ruins show no evidence of former habitation, it is
    evident that they were not dwellings. Their use and the kinship of
    the people who built them can be judged only by what is left of their
    walls and the character of their masonry. As has been pointed out, the
    most prominent of these ruins are circular rooms or towers, arranged
    in clusters, for an interpretation of which we may look to similar
    architectural forms found elsewhere in the Southwest.</p>

  <p>Their commanding position suggests that these towers were constructed
    for lookouts and for defense, but the questions might very pertinently
    be asked, Why should either of these uses necessitate three or four
    almost identical buildings grouped together, when one would be
    sufficient? Why are some of them in places where there is no broad
    outlook?</p>

  <p>The massive character of the walls suggests a fortification, but why
    if defense were the only explanation of their use would not one large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
    building be preferable to many, especially as it would be more easily
    constructed. It might be urged that they were granaries; but if so, why
    were they placed in such a conspicuous situation?</p>

  <p>In searching for an explanation for the construction of these
    buildings, an examination was made of aboriginal towers in the valley
    of the San Juan and its tributaries, especially the Yellow Jacket
    Canyon and those tributaries entering it on the northern side. In the
    Mesa Verde National Park the author has also discovered several towers
    which are in a comparatively good state of preservation. Some of these
    are situated on high cliffs, others stand in valleys hidden by dense
    forests of cedar.</p>

  <p>Towers are, roughly speaking, scattered sporadically in numbers over
    a wide extent of country, bounded on the east by Dolores River and on
    the south by the Mancos River and the San Juan. They extend as far west
    as Montezuma Creek, following it up north as far as exploration has
    gone and occurring as far south as Zuñi. Rarely, if ever, however, do
    we find towers in the dry, sandy, wastes south of the San Juan, and
    they are unrepresented in the great ruins of the Chaco Canyon. Although
    there seemed to be certain minor differences in the construction of
    towers found at different places in this area of distribution, all are
    identical in essential features.</p>

  <p>The towers of Hill Canyon bear a close likeness to those in the region
    mentioned, except that their masonry is poorer and their walls are more
    dilapidated. This can be ascribed in part to the material out of which
    they are built, for whereas the stone in the southern part of the area
    is soft and easily worked, that in the Hill Canyon region is hard but
    can readily be split into slabs which did not require much manipulation
    to bring them into desired shapes for use. The tall and better built
    towers of the San Juan (<a href="#pl14a">pl. 14, <i>a</i></a>) and its tributaries are
    sometimes single rooms without connections with other buildings, but
    are more often surrounded at their bases by rooms not unlike those of
    pueblo ruins. Thus at Cannon Ball ruin the towers rise from the midst
    of secular rooms and the same is true of the tower in Cliff Palace and
    elsewhere. This leads to the supposition that these buildings were
    constructed for some purpose other than as lookouts: they bear all the
    outward appearance of sacred rooms called kivas of pueblos and cliff
    dwellers. If we accept this explanation<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> that the McElmo towers are
    round kivas, as suggested by Holmes, Morgan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> and others we can explain
    why several are united in a cluster, for it would seem that each room
    in such a cluster belonged to a family or clan. The use of these towers
    as here suggested can not, however, be proven until excavations of
    them are made and the signification of the banquette constantly found
    annexed to their inner wall is determined.</p>

  <p>Several structural remains in Ruin Canyon (<a href="#pl14b">pl. 14, <i>b</i></a>), a
    tributary of the Yellow Jacket, especially those at the head of
    the South Fork, give a good idea of the relation of the tower to
    surrounding rooms. Here we find towers constructed of fine, well
    preserved, masonry rising to almost their original height, but crowded
    into the midst of rectangular rooms imparting to the whole ruin a
    compact rectangular form. Several towers in this canyon are without
    surrounding rooms, others have rectangular, square or <span class="sans">D</span>-shaped
    ground plans, but the author studied none with two or three concentric
    surrounding walls.</p>

  <p>The form of one of the largest ruins in Ruin Canyon situated near the
    fork of the canyon, closely resembles Far View House, in the Mesa Verde
    National Park. It has a central tower around which are rooms with
    straight walls, the intervals between which and the circular wall of
    the tower having a roughly triangular shape. While there is but one
    tower in this ruin, its similarity in form and position to the large
    central kiva of Far View House indicates that towers in the McElmo are
    practically ceremonial rooms, as has been long suspected.</p>

  <p>This identity in form of tower and round kiva and the relative
    abundance of both in the San Juan drainage, leads the author to
    believe that one was derived from the other, in that district, and
    spread from it southward and westward until, very much modified, it
    reached the periphery of the pueblo area. It is believed that, in
    the earliest time, the isolated tower was constructed for ceremonial
    purposes and that rooms for habitations were dugouts or other
    structures architecturally different from it. Later, domiciles were
    constructed around the base of these towers until they encircled them
    in a compact mass of rooms. The tower then lost its apparent height,
    but morphologically retained its form. As this circular type of kiva
    spread into the pueblo area in course of time it was again constructed
    independently of the domiciles and the relative numbers diminished
    until, as in some of the pueblos of the Rio Grande, there survive only
    one or two kivas for each village, but these are no longer embedded in
    habitations as in the more advanced archaic conditions.</p>

  <p>The tower kiva may be regarded as the nucleus of the clan, or the
    building erected for ceremonies of that clan, the earliest and best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
    constructed stone structures in the region where the pueblo originated.
    Where there were several clans there were several towers; when one
    clan, a single tower. In course of time rooms for habitation or
    possibly for other purposes, clustered about these towers; these units
    consolidated with rooms and kivas of another type forming a composite
    pueblo. In this form we find the towers rising above a mass of secular
    rooms. The archaic form of ceremonial room or tower survived in Cliff
    Palace and other Mesa Verde ruins.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

  <p>Several circular kivas and towers seen by the author have one or more
    incised stones, bearing a coiled figure resembling a serpent. One of
    the best of these has also peripheral lines like conventional symbols
    of feathers. An obscure legend of the Hopi recounts that the ancestral
    kivas of the Snake clan, when it lived at Tokonabi, or along the San
    Juan were circular in form. While at present only a suggestion, it is
    not improbable that towers and round kivas may have been associated
    with Snake ceremonials, especially as this cult is known to have
    survived among Keresan pueblos like Sia and Acoma. The Snake clan of
    the Hopi according to traditions came from the north or the region of
    circular kivas.</p>

  <p>From their similarity in external shape and distribution, circular
    ruins and round towers have been regarded as in some way connected.
    It by no means follows that rooms inside their external walls were
    identical in use. For instance, the so-called Great Tower on the cliffs
    overlooking the San Juan, described and figured by Prof. Holmes, is
    said by him to measure 140 feet in diameter, and to have double walls
    connected by partitions, forming a series of encircling rooms. This
    ruin may be classified not as a tower but a circular ruin, and the
    same may be said of the so-called Triple-wall Tower, rising on the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>border of rectangular rooms, situated at the mouth of the McElmo. The
    dimensions of this so-called tower are reported to be “almost” the
    same as the Great Tower. The author regards these as examples of an
    architectural type related to towers, from which it is distinguished
    not only by size, but also, especially, by the arrangement of rooms
    on their peripheries. The internal structure of the tower type is
    little known, but in none of these buildings has the author detected
    peripheral rooms separated by radial partitions, although one of these
    radial partitions is found in kiva A of Sun Temple. The original
    building of the last mentioned ruin, although <span class="sans">D</span>-shaped, has a
    morphological similarity in the arrangement of peripheral rooms to the
    “Great Tower” of the San Juan, or that on the alluvial flat in the
    Mancos, and the “Triple-wall Tower” room of the McElmo, save that the
    so-called innermost of the triple walls is replaced in Sun Temple by
    two circular walls, side by side, forming kivas B and C.</p>

  <p>The tower, with annexed rectangular rooms, like its homologue, the
    circular kiva with similar adjacent chambers surrounding it, is
    practically the “unit type,” a stage of pueblo development pointed
    out by Doctor Prudden,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> who does not make as much as would the
    author of the intra-mural condition of the kiva, or its compact union
    with domiciliary rooms. Far View House on the Mesa Verde is a good
    example of this union of form, characteristic of the “unit type” or
    compact pueblo with embedded circular kivas, one of which is central,
    probably the first constructed, and of large size. Such compact pueblos
    are numerous on the Mesa Verde, judging from central depressions in
    mounds, and characteristic of the San Juan, at least of its northern
    tributaries. The previous stage in pueblo development is that in
    which the sanctuary or tower (kiva) and habitation are distinct. The
    extra-mural circular kiva,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> or circular room separated from the
    house masses either in courts, as in Rectangular and Round villages,
    or situated outside the same as in “Line villages,” like Walpi, or
    pyramidal forms, is like Zuñi or Taos and more modern pueblos. This
    modification is widely distributed in ruins south of the San Juan,
    still persisting in several modern pueblos.</p>

  <p>The above observations have an important bearing on the author’s
    differentiation of the village Indians of the Southwest, into two
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>groups, which are culturally distinct and widely distributed
    geographically. The western group originated in the Gila Valley, and
    extending across Arizona spread northward making its influence felt as
    far as the Hopi villages; the eastern culture was born in Colorado and
    Utah and extended to the south along a parallel zone. The former sprang
    into being in low, level, cactus plains; while the latter was born in
    lofty mountains and deep canyons filled with caves. Each reflects in
    its architecture the characteristic environment of the locality of its
    origin. As they spread from their homes and at last came together each
    modified the other by acculturation. The expansion of these two nuclei
    of culture, and the products of their contact is the prehistoric,
    unwritten, evolution of primitive people in the Southwest upon which
    documentary accounts throw no light, and the function of archeology
    is to read this history through the remains left by this prehistoric
    people, as interpreted by surviving folklore, ceremonials, legends,
    and artifacts. Both types of culture reached their highest development
    before the arrival of the white man; and the advent of the European
    found both on the decline. The localities where both types originated
    and reached their highest development were either no longer inhabited
    or occupied by descendants with modified architectural ideas. Some of
    the survivors lived in houses of much ruder construction than the cliff
    dwellings or pueblos of their ancestors. The habitations of others were
    scattered rude, mud huts. In short the cliff dwellers of the Mesa Verde
    and the prehistoric inhabitants of the Gila compounds left survivors
    possessed of inferior skill. Both architecture and ceramic art had
    declined before the advent of white men.</p>

      a monograph, now in preparation, on “Prehistoric Towers of the
      Southwest.” The author has made several new observations on these
      structures some of which differ considerably from those of his
      predecessors.

    <p>Morgan, “Houses and House Life of the American Aborigines” (Contr. to
      Amer. Ethnol., Vol. IV), has pointed out, page 191, that the round
      tower at the base of Ute Mountain must have been entered through
      the roof, as no lateral doorways were visible, and Montgomery’s
      observations on towers in Nine Mile Canyon point the same way.
      These facts tell in favor of the theory that towers and kivas are
      morphologically identical, as Morgan indicates. An absence of pilasters
      on the inner walls of towers indicates that the roof was not vaulted,
      as in most Mesa Verde cliff dwellings and in the pueblo, Far View
      House, of the Mummy Lake group. Towers belong to what I have designated
      the second type of kivas, or those with flat roofs, and are less
      abundant in the San Juan area.</p>
